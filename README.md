# binary-search

# 1. Iterative Binary Search (binary_search.py)
## Description:
- This is an implementation of Binary Search using an iterative approach (with a while loop). Binary Search works efficiently on sorted lists, finding an element in O(logn) time by repeatedly narrowing down the search range.

# Recursive Binary Search (binary_search_recursion.py)
## Description:
- This is an implementation of Binary Search using recursion. Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to search for an element in a sorted list. It repeatedly divides the search range in half, reducing the search time to O(logn).

## Note: 
- These algorithms work only for sorted lists. If the list is unsorted, you must sort it first before using this method.
